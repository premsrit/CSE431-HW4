# Desciption
This is Git Repository for creating experiment for Homework 4 of CSE 431, Algorithm Engineering

## Problem 1

Merge sort has an expected run time of $\Theta(n log n)$; insertion sort has an expected run time of $\Theta(n^2)$. As such, we know that Merge sort will be faster for very large n.  Insertion sort, however, turns out to be faster for very small n.  Your job is to figure out how small.

Compare implementations of Merge sort and Insertion sort, testing each over a range of values for n. Provide a graph of the results, clearly indicating the value on n where the lines cross (or a range of values where they essentially overlap).

You may use your own implementations, in any language you choose, or ones that you find elsewhere, as long as you cite your sources.  You must use a wide enough range of values of n to provide a convincing argument of your answer.


#### Experiment code

Experiment code will measure average running time of merge sort and insertion 
sort on several sizes of input and create figure call figure.png to show the result.  
  

Run the experiment code by
```
python HW4_Q1.py
```
